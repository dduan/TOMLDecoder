# Developing TOMLDecoder

Notes for TOMLDecoder mainateners.

## Generating Code, and Tests

* Parts of code is written using `gyb`. Use the script `Scripts/generate-code.sh`
  to generate the code. The generated code is checked into the repo.
* A subset of tests are generated by directly copying fixtures for the official
  test suite. This is done by a script `Scripts/generate-tests.py`.
  The generated tests and fixtures are checked into the repo. The script
  contains a SHA of the test suite repo from which the tests are copied. Update
  the SHA to get potential newer tests.
* The script `Scripts/test-generate.sh` should be run to verify that the
  generated code and tests are up to date. It exists with a non-zero exit code
  if new code is generated.
